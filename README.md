# weatherData
Adds new 'findWeatherStation' function to R package weatherData. 

User input a dataframe with column of zipcodes and the function returns 
the original dataframe with two new columns -- WeatherStation and 
isAirport. 

These make using getWeatherData much easier as you don't need to know the closest weather 
station a priori.
